## How to create a new 201 project

Follow these steps to create a new code 201 project.

### Step 1 - Clone the boilerplate project

First clone the boilerplate project to your computer in your 201 folder. In terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/tehbillis/code201-boilerplate.git
```

### Step 2 - Create new project repo

Rename the code201-boilerplate folder to the new project name. In terminal:

```
mv old_folder_name new_folder_name
```

### Step 4 - Change project remote URL

Go into the new project folder and run the following commands in terminal:

```
git remote rename origin old-origin

git remote add origin https://github.com/tehbillis/project-name.git
```
