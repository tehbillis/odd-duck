## Odd Duck Products

A kiosk app for a company that creates the next best thing. This app is a randomized survey used to determine which item should be next one that they bring to market. With 3 random and unique products to choose from each round, this application will collect more data than just which one was selected, but also how many times each product was shown. These stats will help the company make its decision on which product to make!
